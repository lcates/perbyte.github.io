Slightly Innovative is the blog of [PerByte](http://www.perbyte.com) developers [Josh Carlson](http://www.twitter.com/joshucar) and [Jason Carr](http://www.jasoncarr.com).

We'll look to cover topics surrounding [Aptify](http://www.aptify.com), [Sitefinity](http://www.sitefinity.com), general .NET development, and anything else that we run into that's worth sharing. We're likely to share some personal things as well, being human and all.
