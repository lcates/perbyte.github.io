First off, as this is my first post, let me introduce myself. I am Josh's #1 peon, er, esteemed colleague, at [PerByte][perb]. And this is apparently what [Google][goog] and [Bing][bing] identify as an "image handler":

This post has nothing to do with [Chelsea Handler][chel], but I am about to drop a metaphorical bomb on you. If you don't happen to be an [Aptify][apt] developer, I'm truly sorry. Here goes.



Boom. There's more helpful code here for an Aptify Ebusiness developer than what is immediately apparent. This code shows you:

- How to retrieve EBusinessGlobal, AptifyApplication, and DataAction classes for data access if they're not immediately available to you

- How to create an HTTP Handler with access to Aptify

- How to read binary data from attachments in Aptify

- And ultimately, how to create a generic handler to dyamically size and download profile pictures from persons in Aptify

To use this code in your Aptify Ebusiness website, simply create a new Generic Handler in Visual Studio, call it AptifyProfilePicture.ashx, and paste the above code into it.

Then, to show a person's profile picture on a page, you can simply put an image tag in your markup like this:

<img src="/AptifyProfilePicture.ashx?id=2353&w=200" alt="Fred" />

Obviously, make sure that the path to AptifyPRofilePicture.ashx matches the location of the handler that you created above. The id query string parameter is of course the PersonID of the person whose profile picture you'd like to display. This will resize the image to a maximum of 200 pixels wide, and adjust the height based on the correct aspect ratio. To use a maximum height instead, simply use the "h" query string parameter in place of the "w" like this:

<img src="/AptifyProfilePicture.ashx?id=2353&h=300" alt="Fred" />

I would hope the rest of this is mostly self explanatory, but please feel free to chime in in the comments if you need assistance; Josh and I are excited to share some of our Aptify development expertise to hopefully reduce the learning curve for Aptify developers.
