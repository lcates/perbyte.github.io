PerByte is a small company that accomplishes a lot of great things for our customers. Whether we're working with them on a configuration, data conversion, or implementation they keep us pretty busy. Being busy, however, is not the same thing as being *too busy*.

As the core of our business work that we do for our customers is obviously very important and always demands a high priority. However, if that were our only priority we should be considered being negligent to those same and future customers. An investment does need to be made in both sharing what we've learned and improving our process.

This blog is an initial example of sharing what we've learned. It's intentionally minimal and has a focus on small but important discoveries. It'll have the occasional rant and philosophical discussion but intends to have a strong lean toward activities in our core competencies (Aptify, Sitefinity, .NET, development, databases, etc.)

What would happen if we were to step back and started collecting a larger scoped package of what we've learned?

##Introducing Core##

Core is, at its simplest, a collection of open source libraries that makes developing for .NET and Aptify more efficient. Utilities, wrapper classes, components, and should-have-been-stock functionality have been wrapped up in an easy to use format.

While still a work-in-progress it's already chock full of good bits that'll help you out immediately. It is open source but we do ask you to [request access](http://www.perbyte.com/powertools/) (be sure to give us your GitHub account name).

##Bringing You More##

As part of our investment in improving *our* process we're building a set of tools that we will make generally available to anyone using the Aptify platform.

Visual Studio, PowerShell, and Aptify will be tightly integrated to bring you templates, scripting capabilities, better testing, debugging, and more.

We have launchers, best practice analyzers, object syncing, and a myriad of other tools planned to generally make <del>our</del> your lives better.

These are still in development but will start becoming available in 2015. [Register now](http://www.perbyte.com/powertools/) and we'll notify you as development matures.
