tl;dr

Every blog has a beginning. This is ours.

ntl;gr

The first post always feels the most forced. A welcome seems out of place since
it's unlikely the first that visitors will read. Telling people about the
exciting topics to come is moot since they aren't read sequentially. An
autobiography isn't appropriate since [no one cares](http://blog.codinghorror.com/users-dont-care-about-you/).

So what's left? An exciting story about how it all started! An awkward tale of
the past written before it happened.

I was working on a fun side project that I intended to make open source. As I
was working on it I decided to tell Jason about how I had always wanted to do a
blog, to be the social coder, do more open source, to [get involved](http://getinvolved.hanselman.com/).
I just never seemed to find the time.

> **Jason:** I could whip you up a site pretty quick.

> **Josh:** I have been tempted.

> **Jason:** It certainly is nice to have my blog up. On the rare occasion that
I do want to post something :wink:

> **Josh:** It can certainly be a positive thing if you start getting traffic,
one just needs to post so much quality stuff to earn the traffic.

> **Jason:** Yea, it's been fun for me, but not really productive in any way,
shape or form.

> **Josh:** It can be, all these <s>stupid</s> fun things we figure out, we
should blog about them :neutral_face:

> **Jason:** If you're dedicated it could be an amazing site, just all takes
time

> **Josh:** Yep. We could co-author one

> **Jason:** Sure, I'd love to. Our PerByte findings as we dev.

So, in an effort to make up for the failings in myself I had enlisted others.
May we fail together.
